# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the systematic process of identifying, documenting, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It acts as the bridge between business objectives and technical implementation, ensuring the final product aligns with user needs and organizational goals.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
<p>1.Foundation for Success. Poorly analyzed requirements cause ~70% of project failures (standish Group). Clear requirements reduce rework costs by up to 10x (IBM).</p>
<p>2. Stakeholder Alignment. Resolves conflicts early (e.g., balancing user needs vs. technical feasibility).</p>
<p>3. Scope Control. Prevents scope creep by defining boundaries (e.g., "The system will support 10,000 concurrent users, not 100,000").</p>
<p>4. Risk Mitigation. Identifies risks early (e.g., regulatory compliance gaps).</p>
<p>5. Efficient Resource Allocation. Guides realistic timelines and budgets (e.g., "Integrating payment gateways requires 3 months").</p>
<p>6. Quality Assurance. Serves as a benchmark for testing (e.g., "Test case TC-01 validates login functionality").</p>

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
<p><b>Requirement Gathering - </b>This process involved the collection of needs and expectations from the stakeholders.</p>
<p><b>Requirement Elicitation - </b>This process invloves getting unstated needs through direct engagement.</p>
<p><b>Requirement Documentation - </b>This is the recording of the requirements as captured from the stakeholders.</p>
<p><b>Requirement Analysis and Modeling - </b>This process involves structuring the requirements into actionalble blueprints.</p>
<p><b>Requirement Validation - </b>This process invloves having the stakeholders to sign off on the requirements.</p>

# Types of Requirements
<p><b>Functional Requirements</b> describe what the system must do while <b>Non-Functional Requirements</b> describe how the system should perform.</p>

<h3>Examples of Functional Requirements</h3>
<p>User registration and Authentication</p>
<p>Property Listing Management</p>

<h3>Examples of Non Functional Requirements</h3>
<p>Performance - Search results load in less than 2secs</p>
<p>Scalability - Handle traffic spikes</p>
